      // Pizza delivery service promises to deliver the pizza. thats's a promise.
      // pizza delivery guy will respond to your request with pizza but if something went wrong it would notify you also with error and without pizza in his hands

      // with .then we can do smth when promise is fulfilled(resolved). and with .catch we can handle smth or do smth when promise is rejected

      // The json() method is asynchronous because it processes data that may not be fully available yet.
      // we use json commonly for sending data from server to website
