      <p>
        I’m a passionate developer who loves building things with code. My
        journey started with JavaScript, and over time, I’ve expanded into
        React, TypeScript, and backend technologies. I enjoy solving complex
        problems, optimizing performance, and learning new tools to stay ahead
        in the ever-evolving tech world. Currently, I’m focused on honing my
        frontend skills, building real-world projects, and preparing to dive
        into backend development. My goal is to become a full-stack developer,
        contribute to open-source projects, and create innovative solutions that
        make a difference. When I’m not coding, I’m probably exploring new tech
        trends, improving my problem-solving skills on LeetCode, or working on
        personal projects.
